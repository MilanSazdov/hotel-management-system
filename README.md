## üìå About

The **Hotel Management System** is a robust and user-friendly application designed to streamline the daily operations of a hotel. Built using Java and the Swing library, this application supports the following key functionalities:

1. **User Roles**:
   - **Administrator**: Full control over hotel operations, including employee management and financial reports.
   - **Receptionist**: Handles reservations, guest check-ins/check-outs, and room assignments.
   - **Housekeeper**: Manages the cleaning schedule and updates room availability status.
   - **Guest**: Allows guests to request reservations, view booking statuses, and add services.

2. **Reservation Management**:
   - Guests can request room reservations for specific dates.
   - Reservation statuses include "Pending," "Confirmed," "Rejected," and "Cancelled."
   - Receptionists can approve or reject requests based on room availability.

3. **Room and Service Management**:
   - Tracks room status: Available, Occupied, or Under Cleaning.
   - Supports additional services like breakfast, laundry, and spa, which can be added to a guest's bill.

4. **Pricing and Reporting**:
   - Dynamic pricing based on the season and room type.
   - Generates reports on income, expenses, room usage, and housekeeping activities.

This project implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a scalable and maintainable solution for managing hotel operations.
